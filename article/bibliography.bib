    abstract = {Progress in understanding cognition requires a quantitative,
    theoretical framework, grounded in the other natural sciences and able to
    bridge between implementational, algorithmic and computational levels of
    explanation. I review recent results in neuroscience and cognitive biology
    that, when combined, provide key components of such an improved conceptual
    framework for contemporary cognitive science. Starting at the neuronal
    level, I first discuss the contemporary realization that single neurons are
    powerful tree-shaped computers, which implies a reorientation of
    computational models of learning and plasticity to a lower, cellular,
    level. I then turn to predictive systems theory (predictive coding and
    prediction-based learning) which provides a powerful formal framework for
    understanding brain function at a more global level. Although most formal
    models concerning predictive coding are framed in associationist terms, I
    argue that modern data necessitate a reinterpretation of such models in
    cognitive terms: as model-based predictive systems. Finally, I review the
    role of the theory of computation and formal language theory in the recent
    explosion of comparative biological research attempting to isolate and
    explore how different species differ in their cognitive capacities.
    Experiments to date strongly suggest that there is an important difference
    between humans and most other species, best characterized cognitively as a
    propensity by our species to infer tree structures from sequential data.
    Computationally, this capacity entails generative capacities above the
    regular (finite-state) level; implementationally, it requires some neural
    equivalent of a push-down stack. I dub this unusual human propensity
    “dendrophilia”, and make a number of concrete suggestions about how such a
    system may be implemented in the human brain, about how and why it evolved,
    and what this implies for models of language acquisition. I conclude that,
    although much remains to be done, a neurally-grounded framework for
    theoretical cognitive science is within reach that can move beyond
    polarized debates and provide a more adequate theoretical future for
    cognitive biology.}
